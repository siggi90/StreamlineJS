# StreamlineJS

Streamline is a web development framework created by Noob Software.

An example of a Streamline webpage is https://github.com/siggi90/sl_cv which is a publications/cv website intended for displaying publications. This template is a single user page with a admin/content management interface.

Streamline is a very efficient way to develop web apps/web pages. The support page for the JSON definition is still under construction but in the meanwhile the JSON definition functionality can be infered from the sl_cv template. Streamline allows for complex behaviour with relativly simple definitions. The corrosponding PHP code must be coded from scratch, but no JavaScript coding is neccessary. Streamline also allows custom code and custom frames. If you want to extend the functionality beyond what Streamline has to offer.

Streamline web pages are fully ajaxed, which means you never have to reload the web page. Link hashes are used to navigate through the web page without reloading the page so navigated pages are placed in the history of the browser and can be bookmarked and the back button navigates to the last page. Animations can be applied when switching between pages.
