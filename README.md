# StreamlineJS

Streamline is a web development framework created by Noob Software. This repository is also for Noob Cloud, the "streamline" setting in the config.php file changes whether you use Streamline for Web Development or as Noob Cloud.

An example of a Streamline webpage is https://github.com/siggi90/sl_cv which is a publications/cv website intended for displaying publications. This template is a single user page with a admin/content management interface.

Noob Cloud is the server-side software for Noob Applications. Note you have to purchase Noob Cloud to use it for Noob Apps. Streamline is also intended for sale but is available for download for testing and experimenting.
